# Minimal Python dependencies for VectorJIT
# numpy is required by the library and tests/benchmarks
numpy>=1.24.0

# Test / benchmark tooling (optional)
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-benchmark>=4.0.0

# Notes:
# - The project also generates and compiles C/C++ code (OpenMP/NEON). On macOS you may
#   need to install libomp (e.g. `brew install libomp`) and a C++ toolchain.
